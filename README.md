### Introduction

Welcome to the official course site for Python and Biopython. I hope to make this a hands-on, problem-solving course designed specifically for undergraduate biotechnology students. This course introduces you to the world of computational biology, using Python as a gateway to analyze biological data, automate tasks, and explore the vast landscape of genomic research.

### Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand Python fundamentals relevant to bioinformatics
- Work with biological sequences using the Biopython library
- Parse and manipulate FASTA, GenBank, and GFF files
- Perform sequence analysis (e.g., translation, transcription, motif search)
- Fetch data from online biological databases (e.g., NCBI, UniProt)
- Build scripts and mini-projects to solve real-world biological problems
