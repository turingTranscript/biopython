### Why This Course?

In the age of vast biological data, programming skills are indispensable for any biotechnologist. This course empowers you to automate tasks, analyze large datasets, develop custom solutions, and critically interpret computational results in your biological research.

### Who is This Course For?

This course is designed for **2nd Year Undergraduate Biotechnology Students** with little to no prior programming experience. If you're a biologist eager to unlock the power of computation, this course is for you\!

### What Will You Learn?

Upon completing this course, you will be able to:

- Understand fundamental programming concepts using Python.
- Write, debug, and execute Python programs for biological data manipulation.
- Effectively handle, parse, and analyze various biological file formats.
- Utilize the Biopython library for essential bioinformatics workflows (e.g., sequence analysis, database queries).
- Apply computational approaches to solve introductory biological problems using Python and its specialized libraries.

### Our Approach to Learning

- **Flipped Classroom:** You'll engage with core concepts before class through readings and videos, freeing up class time for active learning.
- **Software Carpentry-style Live Coding:** Sessions are highly interactive, with instructors demonstrating code step-by-step and guiding you through immediate practice.
- **Hands-on Lab Sessions:** Dedicated weekly labs provide extensive practical experience applying concepts to biological problems.
- **Spaced Repetition:** Assignments are designed to revisit and reinforce topics from previous weeks, aiding long-term retention.

### Course Structure at a Glance

The course is structured over 12 weeks, progressing from foundational Python to advanced biological applications:

  * **Module 1:** Core Python Fundamentals
  * **Module 2:** Organizing Data and Interacting with Files
  * **Module 3:** Biopython - The Biologist's Toolkit
